"Name: Saola\nScientific: Pseudoryx nghetinhensis\nPeriod: Modern (Discovered 1992)\nDescription:\nThe saola is one of the world's rarest mammals, sometimes called the \"Asian unicorn\" due to its long, straight horns and elusive nature.\nFound only in dense jungle biomes, saola are extremely shy and rarely seen. They are peaceful herbivores that feed on forest vegetation.\nSaola cannot be tamed but will flee when approached. They are critically endangered and should be protected rather than hunted.\nThese mysterious animals were unknown to science until 1992, making them one of the largest land mammals discovered in the 20th century."
