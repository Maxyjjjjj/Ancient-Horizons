"Name: Mountain Goat\nScientific: Oreamnos americanus\nPeriod: Modern\nDescription:\nMountain goats are sure-footed ungulates native to mountainous regions. Despite their name, they are not true goats but are more closely related to antelopes.\nFound in mountain biomes, these hardy animals can navigate steep cliffs with ease. They will ram into players and mobs that get too close.\nMountain goats can be bred using wheat. They occasionally drop horns when ramming into solid blocks, which can be used to craft instruments.\nTheir thick white coats protect them from harsh mountain weather, and their specialized hooves provide excellent grip on rocky surfaces."
