"Name: Zebra\nScientific: Equus quagga\nPeriod: Modern\nDescription:\nZebras are distinctive members of the horse family, easily recognized by their bold black and white stripes. Each zebra has a unique stripe pattern, like a fingerprint.\nFound in African savanna biomes, zebras are social animals that live in herds for protection against predators.\nZebras can be tamed similarly to horses and can be bred with horses to create zorses, or with donkeys to create zonkeys.\nTheir stripes may help confuse predators and regulate body temperature in the hot savanna climate."
