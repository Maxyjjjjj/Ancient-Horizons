"Name: Diplodocus\nScientific: Diplodocus carnegii\nPeriod: Late Jurassic (155-145 million years ago)\nDescription:\nDiplodocus is one of the longest dinosaurs ever discovered, with some specimens reaching over 25 meters in length. Its distinctive long neck and whip-like tail make it easily recognizable.\nThese gentle giants were herbivores that fed on low-lying vegetation and could rear up on their hind legs to reach higher branches.\nDiplodocus can be tamed and ridden once fully grown, making them excellent mounts for crossing large distances. They are peaceful unless provoked.\nDespite their massive size, Diplodocus were relatively light for their length due to hollow bones, similar to modern birds."
