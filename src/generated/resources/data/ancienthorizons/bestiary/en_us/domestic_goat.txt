"Name: Domestic Goat\nScientific: Capra hircus\nPeriod: Modern (Domesticated ~10,000 years ago)\nDescription:\nDomestic goats are hardy livestock animals raised for milk, meat, and fiber. They are known for their curious nature and ability to climb steep terrain.\nFound in various biomes, domestic goats are browsers that eat leaves, twigs, and shrubs rather than grass. They can be bred using wheat.\nGoats provide milk when milked with a bucket, and meat when slaughtered. Some varieties produce wool that can be sheared.\nThese intelligent animals are more closely related to wild ibex than to mountain goats, and have been essential to human agriculture for millennia."
